There are 2 variant of kokkos port.
Each of them can target either OpenMP or CUDA backend.
To build you only need to set env variable KOKKOS_PATH
to kokkos install directory.

OpenMP backend is not very efficient on small domain size, but is ok
for large domain (i.e. 1024x1024).
There is room for improvement.

version 1: (cxx)
Use both 1d and 2d Kokkos views.

version 2: (cxx_v2)
Only use 1d kokkos views.
OpenMP seems more efficient than in version 1.
Cuda has the same performance as in version 1, and
almost the same as the CUDA port in directory miniapp/cuda/src
